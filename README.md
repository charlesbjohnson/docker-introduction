# docker-introduction

This is a short & simple introduction to Docker that was presented to the SEO team at @WalmartLabs on May 4th, 2015.

Thank you to Bryan Helmkamp for presenting [Shipping Ruby Apps with Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVN7aTqr550)
at Pivotal Labs NY last year which inspired me to learn more about Docker. Much of the content in this presentation builds off of
his great talk.

You can see the actual slideshow on the project page, [here](http://charlesbjohnson.github.io/docker-introduction).
